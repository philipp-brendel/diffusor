# Diffusor

A simple macOS application for exploring image processing filters.

## Usage

Compile the application using Xcode. 

Run the application, choose a filter from the dropdown and drop some image files
onto the application's window.

Warning: The image processing code is not particularly optimized for
performance and may take a while to process larger images. Best stick to images
with lower resolutions to get quick results.
